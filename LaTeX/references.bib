	Abstract = {Graph database models can be defined as those in which data structures for the schema and instances are modeled as graphs or generalizations of them, and data manipulation is expressed by graph-oriented operations and type constructors. These models took off in the eighties and early nineties alongside object-oriented models. Their influence gradually died out with the emergence of other database models, in particular geographical, spatial, semistructured, and XML. Recently, the need to manage information with graph-like nature has reestablished the relevance of this area. The main objective of this survey is to present the work that has been conducted in the area of graph database modeling, concentrating on data structures, query languages, and integrity constraints.},

	abstract = {Databases and database theory have been around for a long time. Early rendi- tions of databases centered around a single database serving every purpose known to the information processing community—from transaction to batch processing to analytical processing. In most cases, the primary focus of the early database systems was operational—usually transactional—processing. In recent years, a more sophisticated notion of the database has emerged—one that serves operational needs and another that serves informational or analyti- cal needs. To some extent, this more enlightened notion of the database is due to the advent of PCs, 4GL technology, and the empowerment of the end user.},

@article{Chen2008,
	Abstract = {OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) is an important notion in data analysis. Recently, more and more graph or networked data sources come into being. There exists a similar need to deploy graph analysis from different perspectives and with multiple granularities. However, traditional OLAP technology cannot handle such demands because it does not consider the links among individual data tuples. In this paper, we develop a novel graph OLAP framework, which presents a multi-dimensional and multi-level view over graphs. The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, starting from basic definitions, i.e., what are dimensions and measures in the graph OLAP scenario, we develop a conceptual framework for data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations, and classify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological OLAP. Then, with more emphasis on informational OLAP (topological OLAP will be covered in a future study due to the lack of space), we show how a graph cube can be materialized by calculating a special kind of measure called aggregated graph and how to implement it efficiently. This includes both full materialization and partial materialization where constraints are enforced to obtain an iceberg cube. We can see that the aggregated graphs, which depend on the graph properties of underlying networks, are much harder to compute than their traditional OLAP counterparts, due to the increased structural complexity of data. Empirical studies show insightful results on real datasets and demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed optimizations.},

In this paper we focus on two enabling technologies for this new generation, namely distribution and personalization. In particular, to support complex business scenarios where multiple partner companies cooperate towards a common goal, we outline a distributed architecture based on a network of collaborative, autonomous, and heterogeneous peers, each offering monitoring and decision support functionalities to the other peers. Then we discuss some issues related to OLAP query reformulation on peers, showing how it can be achieved using semantic mappings between the local multidimensional schemata of peers. Finally, as to personalization, we discuss the benefits of annotating OLAP queries with preferences, focusing in particular on how preferences enable peer heterogeneity in a distributed context to be overcome. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

	Abstract = {As information continues to grow at an explosive rate, more and more heterogeneous network data sources are coming into being. While OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) techniques have been proven effective for analyzing and mining structured data, unfortunately, to our best knowledge, there are no OLAP tools available that are able to analyze multi-dimensional heterogeneous networks from different perspectives and with multiple granularities. Therefore, we have developed a novel HMGraph OLAP (Heterogeneous and Multi-dimensional Graph OLAP) framework for the purpose of providing more dimensions and operations to mine multi-dimensional heterogeneous information network. After information dimensions and topological dimensions, we have been the first to propose entity dimensions, which represent an important dimension for heterogeneous network analysis. On the basis of this notion, we designed HMGraph OLAP operations named (Rotate and Stretch for entity dimensions, which are able to mine relationships between different entities. We then proposed the HMGraph Cube, which is an efficient data warehousing model for HMGraph OLAP. In addition, through comparison with common strategies, we have shown that the optimizations we have proposed deliver better performance. Finally, we have implemented a HMGraph OLAP prototype, LiterMiner, which has proven effective for the analysis of multi-dimensional heterogeneous networks.},

	Abstract = {The importance of graphs as the fundamental structure underpinning many real world applications is no longer to be proved. Large graphs have emerged in various fields such as biological, social and transportation networks. The sheer volume of these networks poses challenges to traditional techniques for storage and analysis of graph data. In particular, OLAP analysis requires access to large portions of data to extract key information and to feed strategic decision making. OLAP provides multilevel, multiperspective views of the data. Most of the current techniques are optimized for centralized graph processing. A distributed approach providing horizontal scalability is required in order to handle the analysis workload. In this paper, we focus on applying OLAP analysis on large, distributed graph data. We describe Distributed Graph Cube, our distributed framework for graph-based OLAP cubes computation and aggregation. Experimental results on large, real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms its centralized counterparts. We also evaluate the performance of both Hadoop and Spark for distributed cubes computations.},

External data (particularly web data), may be useful to enhance local analysis. In this paper we discuss the extraction of multidimensional data from web sources, and their representation in RDFS. We introduce Open Cubes, an RDFS vocabulary for the specification and publication of multidimensional cubes on the Semantic Web, and show how classical OLAP operations can be implemented over Open Cubes using SPARQL 1.1, without the need of mapping the multidimensional information to the local database (the usual approach to multidimensional analysis of Semantic Web data). We show that our approach is plausible for the data sizes that can usually be retrieved to enhance local data repositories. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Zhao2011,
	Abstract = {We consider extending decision support facilities toward large sophisticated networks, upon which multidimensional at- tributes are associated with network entities, thereby forming the so-called multidimensional networks. Data warehouses and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) techno ogy have proven to be effective tools for decision support on relational data. However, they are not well-equipped to handle the new yet important multidimensional networks. In this paper, we introduce Graph Cube, a new data warehousing model that supports OLAP queries effectively on large multidimensional networks. By taking account of both attribute aggregation and structure summarization of the networks, Graph Cube goes beyond the traditional data cube model involved solely with numeric value based group-by's, thus resulting in a more insightful and structure-enriched aggregate network within every possible multidimensional space. Besides traditional cuboid queries, a new class of OLAP queries, crossboid, is introduced that is uniquely useful in multidimensional networks and has not been studied before. We implement Graph Cube by combining special characteristics of multidimensional networks with the existing well-studied data cube techniques. We perform extensive experimental studies on a series of real world data sets and Graph Cube is shown to be a powerful and efficient tool for decision support on large multidimensional networks.},

@article{Wang2014,
	Abstract = {Attributed graphs are becoming important tools for modeling information networks, such as the Web and various social networks (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter). However, it is computationally challenging to manage and analyze attributed graphs to support effective decision making. In this paper, we propose, Pagrol, a parallel graph OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) system over attributed graphs. In particular, Pagrol introduces a new conceptual Hyper Graph Cube model (which is an attributed-graph analogue of the data cube model for relational DBMS) to aggregate attributed graphs at different granularities and levels. The proposed model supports different queries as well as a new set of graph OLAP Roll-Up/Drill-Down operations. Furthermore, on the basis of Hyper Graph Cube, Pagrol provides an efficient MapReduce-based parallel graph cubing algorithm, MRGraph-Cubing, to compute the graph cube for an attributed graph. Pagrol employs numerous optimization techniques: (a) a self-contained join strategy to minimize I/O cost; (b) a scheme that groups cuboids into batches so as to minimize redundant computations; (c) a cost-based scheme to allocate the batches into bags (each with a small number of batches); and (d) an efficient scheme to process a bag using a single MapReduce job. Results of extensive experimental studies using both real Facebook and synthetic datasets on a 128-node cluster show that Pagrol is effective, efficient and scalable.},
